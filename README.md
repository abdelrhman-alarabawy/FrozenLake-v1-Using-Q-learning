# FrozenLake-v1-Using-Q-learning
FrozenLake-v1 is a classic reinforcement learning environment provided by OpenAI's Gym library. In this environment, an agent navigates a grid-world represented as a frozen lake, aiming to reach a goal avoiding falling into holes. The grid is typically a square grid, where each tile can be either frozen (safe to walk on) or a hole (unsafe).
